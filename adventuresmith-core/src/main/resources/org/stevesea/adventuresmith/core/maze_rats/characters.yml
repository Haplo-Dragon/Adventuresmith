# keywords in templates must appear as keys in the tables map of this
# file (or as keys in the tables of specified sibling files in this same directory
# see merged_siblings_tables)
#
# implementation notes:
# - the 'merged_sibling_tables' is a list of file prefixes which must be located
#   in the same directory as the current file.
#
# - templates are Mustache templates (specifically, jmustache). so, you can
#   probably do some strange and awful things with them. And, probably break the app.
#
# - the context passed to the template compiler is this file's table, plus any
#   tables defined in the sibling tables. Tables are applied to the context in
#   reverse order of entry in the 'siblings' table, and then this file's tables.
#
#   If there are any naming collisions, they'll be silently overriden in the above order.
#   Tables are _not_ merged.

include_tables:
- names

# a dice list is optional. If used, it'll add dice keywords like the tables keywords to the template.
#   example:  {{3d6}}
#
# alternatively, you can use a partial
#   example:  {{>1d6}}
#
#   TODO: partial syntax will probably change to something like:
#       {{> dice: 1d6}}
#       {{> pick 3 appearance ,}}

- 3d6


# tables is a map of adventuresmith RangeMaps. In terms of YaML syntax, these are just
# lists of Strings. Overlapping ranges are not permitted and will be flagged as errors.
# Holes in the accumulated set of ranges should be avoided, but is not strictly enforced.
#
# examples:
#
#  the following two rangemaps  are equivalent
#
#    tables:
#       heritage_ex1:
#       - 1..3, human    # ranges should be of form X..Y, where X and Y are integers. and X<=Y
#       - 4, halfling    # ranges can be a single entry. this becomes range X..X
#       - dwarf          # or none.  This becomes X=last line's max+1 ... X..X
#       - 6, elf
#
#       heritage_ex2:
#       - human
#       - human
#       - human
#       - halfling
#       - dwarf
