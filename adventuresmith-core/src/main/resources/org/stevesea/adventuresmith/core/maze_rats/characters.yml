# keywords in templates must appear as keys in the tables map of this
# file (or as keys in the tables of imported files in this same directory
# see 'imports')
#
# Template notes:
#   Templates are Mustache templates (specifically, jmustache). so, you can probably do some
#   strange and awful things with them. And, probably break the app.
#
#   I'm probably abusing Mustache, but it felt like the cleanest way to inject some custom syntax
#   into the templates was via partials
#
#      {{>roll: 2d6+1}}             results in 2d6+1 roll.
#      {{>roll: 2*(1d4+2d20)}}      it can get silly
#      {{>rollN: 2 2*(1d4+2d20)}}   be silly twice
#
#      {{>pick: <dice> <key>}}   result is using given dice roll to select 1 item from the given context key
#              example:
#                    {{>pick: 1d12 weapon}}
#
#      {{>pickN: <dice/#> <key> <delim>}}  result is picking <dice> # of unique items from key, and separating them with the given delimeter
#               example:
#                    {{>pickN: 2 weapon}}
#                             picks 2 weapons, outputs each comma-separated
#                    {{>pickN: 1d2+2 weapon}}
#                             picks 2-4 weapons, outputs each comma-separated
#                    {{>pickN: 1d2+2 weapon ;&nbsp;}}
#                             same as above, but separated with semi-colon
#
#   Another oddity of how I process the templates is that I repeatedly process the template's
#   result (up to 5 times). Unnecessary for most generators, but very handy for others.
#      (example: see the Fourth Page generators for example)
#
#
# implementation notes:
# - the 'imports' is a list of file prefixes which must be located
#   in the same directory as the current file.
#
# - the context passed to the template compiler is this file's table, plus any
#   tables defined in the sibling tables. Tables are applied to the context in
#   reverse order of entry in the 'siblings' table, and then this file's tables.
#
#   Tables are _not_ merged. If there are any naming collisions, an error will be thrown
#
#   Names must be unique across all entries in these files.
#    definitions, tables, nested_tables cannot include items with the same name.
