  evolution:
  - "New holy book; someone in the faith's past penned or discovered a text that is now taken to be
    holy writ and the expressed will of the divine."
  - "New prophet; this faith reveres the words and example of a relatively recent prophet, esteeming
    him or her as the final word on the will of God. The prophet may or may not still be living."
  - "Neofundamentalism; the faith is fiercely resistant to perceived innovations and deviations from
    their beliefs. Even extremely onerous traditions and restrictions will be observed to the letter."
  - "Quietism; the faith shuns the outside world and involvement with the affairs of nonbelievers.
    They prefer to keep their own kind and avoid positions of wealth and power."
  - "Sacrifices; the faith finds it necessary to make substatial sacrifices to please God. Some
    faiths may go so far as to offer human sacrifices, while others insist on huge tithes offered
    to the building of religious edifices."
  - "Schism; the faith's beliefs are actually almost identical to those of the majority of its origin
    tradition, save for a few minor points of vital interest to theologians and no practical difference
    whatsoever to believers. This does not prevent a burning resentment towards the parent faith."
  - "Holy family; God's favor has been shown especially to members of a particular lineage. It may be
    that only men and women of this bloodline are permitted to become clergy, or they may serve as
    helpless figureheads for the real leaders of the faith."
  - "Syncretism; The faith has merged many of its beliefs with another religion [{{origin}}].
    This faith has reconciled the major elements of both beliefs into its tradition."
