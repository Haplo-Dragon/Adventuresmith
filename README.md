This is an Android/Groovy application for randomly generating various
things for tabletop RPGs (names, spells, items, monsters, etc). The 
content for this application was taken with permission from the following
sources:

## Goals

I learn new things best when I've got a project to work on. I decided
to learn more about Groovy and Android development, and this seemed like
a tool I could get personal use out of when DMing.

## todo

- use recyclerview instead of listview
- move data into separate package/module
- more dagger goodness
- more swissknife goodness
- image buttons? (game-icons.net)
